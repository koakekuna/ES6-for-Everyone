# ES6 for Everyone

Hello! This repo is for tracking and documenting the lessons from Wes Bos's ES6 for Everyone course. I also include summaries of lessons learned after each topic.

# Module 1

- 3 way to declare variables: `var`, `const`, and `let`
  - `var` is *function* scoped, and could bleed into the global variables
  - `let` and `const` are *block* scoped, meaning they are always contained within a pair of curly braces
  - `let` variables can be redeclared, while `const` variables cannot be updated once declared
